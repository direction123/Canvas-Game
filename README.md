# Classic Arcade Game

## Description
This is the project of "object oriented javascript" from Udacity.

## How to play
In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. Use arrow keys in the keyboard to control the movement of the player. The enemies move on the paved block portion of the scene. Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
